This is a fun project, creating stories with emojis like the old egypts did that with there hieroglyphs. So this is why I created emojiglyphs for fun.

I saw some hashtags for [#emojiglyph](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23emojiglyph) and [#emojiglyphs](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23emojiglyphs) on twitter, maybe we can use it again :). I saw only a couple of them.
